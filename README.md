### Adaptive SIR models 
:bug:

We study the adaptive human behavior model implemented in the article [Adaptive human behavior in epidemiological models](https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.1011250108#:~:text=Adaptive%20behavior%20implies%20disease%20transmission,once%20a%20disease%20has%20emerged.)

- `notes/` contains some annotations on the article.
- `references/` contains main related references.
- `design/` contains a jupyter notebook with some implementation designs and drafts for both classical and adaptive.
